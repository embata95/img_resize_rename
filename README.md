Bulk resize and rename tool

This tool is used to limit a set of images to max width or height, change their extension and make their names alphanumeric only.<br/>
<b>Important: If the image is smaller than the max width or height, its size won't change at all</b>

This script works through the console and you will be prompted to enter:
<ul>
<li>Path to the original iamges</li>
<li>Path to the folder to save the updated images</li>
<li>Desired extension for the images</li>
<li>Max width and height for the images</li>
<li>Print the names of the updated images (Optional)</li>
</ul>
